> *Summary* â€” Identifying the clinical associations of genetic variants remains crucial in understanding how the human genome modulates disease risk. Traditional phenome-wide association studies consider each disease phenotype as an independent variable; however, diseases often present as complex clusters of comorbid conditions. In this study, we evaluated topic modeling to model electronic health record data as a mixture of topics (e.g., disease clusters) and tested associations between topics and genetic variants. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of using topic modeling to replicate and discover associations between the human genome and clinical diseases.
